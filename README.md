# Bike Pals

## Mission Statement:
"At Bike Pals, we’re more than just a bike shop—we’re a hub for cyclists,  and tinkerers. Founded by two lifelong friends with a love for bikes and community, our shop is all about bringing people together. Here, you’ll find more than tools and repairs; you’ll find shared laughter, great conversations, and a welcoming old-school vibe. Whether you’re fixing a flat, swapping parts, or just hanging out, Bike Pals is your go-to spot to connect, have fun, and keep the wheels spinning."

This website helps people from new joiners to bike enthusiasts to find a place where they can buy and repair their bikes while joining to the cycling community.
